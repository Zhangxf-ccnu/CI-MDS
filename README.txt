README file for MATLAB source code supporting the paper "Dominating Tissue-Specific Protein Interaction Networks".


Contents of this archive
------------------------
This archive contains several MATLAB scripts used to determine driver proteins using the CI-MDS model presented in the above paper. 

(1) CI_MDS.m: MATLAB script that identify driver proteins using the CI-MDS model.
(2) CI_MDS_demo.m: A simple MATLAB script used to test CI-MDS. 

This archive also contains a folder named as "TissueNet" which includes the 16 tissue-specific networks constructed in this study.

Note that if you would like to use library "lp_solve" (http://lpsolve.sourceforge.net/5.5/),
please ensure it has been installed correctly; if you want to use function "intlinprog" (http://www.mathworks.com/help/optim/ug/intlinprog.htm), 
please use MATLAB 2014b or later.

This archive also contains the library "lp_solve" that we use on a Microsoft Windows operating system.

Please do not hesitate to contact Prof. Dao-Qing Dai at stsddq@mail.sysu.edu.cn (or Dr. Xiao-Fei Zhang at zhangxf@mail.ccnu.edu.cn) to 
seek any clarifications regarding any contents or operation of the archive.
